# Euler7_Python

Problem 7 of Project Euler solved in Python 3 using PyCharm. A Prime Number generator was borrowed from Stack Overflow User [Robert William Hanks](https://stackoverflow.com/users/350331/robert-william-hanks) (See Links and References). This algorithm was borrowed as a more efficient replacement to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, as this algorithm utilizes python's capability to manipulate list slices instead of individual index modifications.

## Project Euler Problem 7 -- 10,001<sup>st</sup> Prime

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6<sup>th</sup> prime is 13.

What is the 10 001<sup>st</sup> prime number?
